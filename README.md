# MysteryDots
DESCRIPTION:
A very simple dots made with the SFML library (http://www.sfml-dev.org/).

PURPOSE:
This game was created to demo the use of SFML on the Raspberry Pi.  Since the Raspbian OS added an experimental GL driver, games running on SFML can run on the RPi 2 or 3.  The code was designed to make it easy to change certain characteristics of the game.  When demonstrating the RPi to non-coders or beginners, this game illustrates and promotes how easy it is to make modification to code.

DESCRIPTION:
Player controls a little dots and needs to stay alive for the longest time possible.  NOTE: MysteryDots needs a gamepad controller play.

INSTALLATION:
