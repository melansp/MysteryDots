# MysteryDots
DESCRIPTION:
A very simple dots made with the SFML library (http://www.sfml-dev.org/).

PURPOSE:
I created this game to demo the use of SFML on the Raspberry Pi.  It works very well with since the Raspbian OS added an experimental GL driver.  The code was designed to make it easy to change certain characteristics of the game.  So when demonstrating the RPi to non-coders, I can show them the lanucher.cpp to illustrate and promote how easy it can be to make modification to code.

DESCRIPTION:
Player controls a little dots and needs to stay alive for the longest time possible.  NOTE: MysteryDots needs a gamepad controller play.
